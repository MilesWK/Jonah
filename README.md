Jonah also has three slash commands: 
- `/information` - Gives information about the bot.
- `/me` - Gives detailed information about you.
- `/nuke [Optional: amount]` - This command allows administrators to remove all or a certain amount of messages from a channel. *Note: This only works in a server*
